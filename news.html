    <a href="/gallery.html">The galleries</a> have received an extensive
    facelift. Go check to see what manner of eldritch imagery I've supplied the
    internet with <i>this</i> time.

    I have recently collaborated with
    <a href="http://malkyru.deviantart.com/">Malkyru</a> on emergency
    commissions to help fund my cost of living. [/starvingartist.] The result
    has been experimental, and occasionally unique, digital pieces.

    All of the galleries have now been stocked with art and photos of an oft
    questionable nature.

      I will also be attempting to implement both Facebook buttons and a mobile
      redirect, but this may not happen for some time. As usual, many,
      <i>many</i> thanks to Neolmas for his programming prowess and obstinate
      patience with troubleshooting.

    Big changes are coming within the next few days, so keep your eyes and ears
    open. I'll likely even be using the mailing list for its intended purpose.
    <p>
      As always, in the meanwhile you can find art, info, links, and really
      everything you'll ever need in life by (what else?) scrolling
      horizontally.

    <!--   **********COMMENTED OUT BELOW (old news)********

After a long, knuckle-biting wait, Hotherym.net is finally operational! Currently you'll find here the wonderful Forums that you already found, as well as the brand-new galleries that will soon teem with images. This is also your one stop shop for all your Eorhythm links you previously had to hunt down.<p>

Soon to appear: more info about Eorhythm and the site, fascinating music (made mostly by other people... so far) and other media, and who knows what other shit.  

To contact us for now, the Forums are a terrific place to do so. If you want to keep it private or you're too scared to register on the forum, if you have questions, complaints, gripes, death threats, anonymous love letters, &c. for Eorhythm, e-mail <a href="mailto:orbyss@hotherym.net">Eorhythm</a>. Anything to do with the website (feedback on the wacky design/interface is always appreciated) should go to <a href="mailto:neolmas@gmail.com">Neolmas</a>.<p>

Enjoy and stay tuned!<p>

Production diary below:<p>

<div class=date>2007.01.21 -</div>

Amid no fanfare, the site did go live. The mimi on the welcome/selector page no longer announces of an imminent coming.  This is big. On the main page, the "Eorhythm' Life" section has been expanded to include the first true sub-page, the <a href="about.html" target="_new">about</a> page!  Eorhythm is diligently working on prepping her art for the galleries (though nothing uploaded at time of writing). Keep checking the galleries or this log for updates.

<hr>

<div class=date>2007.01.20 -</div>

Gallery customization is all but complete and the Eorhythm itself is working on populating it with its art and such. Further tweaks are currently being made, but the site will go live tonight! The page as a whole still needs more work, there are important features yet missing, but Hotherym.net is ready for public consumption. Is the public ready for <i>it</i>? We hope not.

<div class=date>2007.01.16 -</div>

The past month saw some activity towards the beginning (browser-specific troubleshooting and even some success thanks to great members at the Opera forum), but tapered off as the paying job ramped up. This was mostly because the next phase is rather labor intensive, and is now facilitated by a new laptop, so work is underway on the gallery.<p> 
Hotherym.net is using the venerable <a href="http://gallery.menalto.com" target="_new">Gallery2</a> software and working with the Carbon user-contributed theme. Now that preliminaries are decided and initial difficulties have been all but overcome, customization on the Hotherym.net <a href="/gallery/" target="_new">galleries</a> can begin! Stylesheet and template and graphic modification, oh my! After headway has been made on integrating the software into the site's layout and look, there are fun modules to be explored. Boy, this is a lot more fruitful than doing the whole thing by scratch.<p>
Progress will accelerate.

<div class=date>2006.12.03 -</div>

Further development was not as dramatic but still quite significant. Content is beginning to flesh itself out and help develop a coherent look at what the main page should actually be. Initial tweaks to the graphic element can be made and the colour palette reinforces itself. Morale is strong.


<hr>


<div class=date>2006.12.02 -</div>

Work on the main page officially starts. While not entirely unstarted (some testing had been done on elements, but only minimal), this was effectively from scratch. The ideas had been sketched on paper and the basic layout and navigation methods had already been determined. The Drii art finished, the plans sprung into action.<br>
Eorhythm created the background image to Neolmas' specifications (it was a collaborative effort) and she isolated the Drii for Neolmas' manipulation into the system. Within hours the site was well underway.

The Mauritanian embassy has recently announced intentions to renounce all previous trade agreements with the United States in an effort to reinforce the nation's sovereignty. Mauritanian officials have voiced displeasure in the past about the state of their country's relationship with the American powerhouse.<br>
This is the first time measures have been taken in this respect. Americans are not likely to balk at this development as Mauritania is the leading source of the U.S.'s corn flake industry.<p>
